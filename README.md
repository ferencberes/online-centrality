========================

This repository contains the code related to the research of [Ferenc Béres](https://github.com/ferencberes), [Róbert Pálovics](https://github.com/rpalovics) and András A. Benczúr. If you are interested in our work then you can read the full [paper](https://appliednetsci.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s41109-018-0080-5) or check out the [poster](https://github.com/ferencberes/online-centrality/raw/master/documents/mlg_2018_poster.pdf) that I presented at the 14th International Workshop on
Mining and Learning with Graphs (KDD18).

# Requirements

   * UNIX environment
   * **Python 3.5** conda environment with pre-installed jupyter:

   ```bash
   conda create -n YOUR_CONDA_PY3_ENV python=3.5 jupyter
   source activate YOUR_CONDA_PY3_ENV
   ```
   * Install the following packages with *conda* or *pip*:
      * **data processing:** pandas, numpy
      * **scientific:** scipy, networkx, editdistance
      * **visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn
      * **general:** sys, os, math, re, json, shutil, operator, collections, multiprocessing, functools, itertools, datetime, pytz

# Data

The **US Open 2017 (UO17)** and **Roland-Garros 2017 (RG17)** Twitter datasets are available on the [website](https://dms.sztaki.hu/hu/letoltes/temporal-katz-centrality-data-sets) of our research group.

You can also download all related data sets with the following command
```bash
bash ./scripts/download_data.sh
```

# Usage

After you have downloaded the data sets (see previous section) you can run the experiments with the provided scripts or you can experiment with Jupyter notebooks as well.

You can simply run all the following steps with one script but it will take many time. Look for details in the next section (Calculate centrality scores).

```bash
source activate YOUR_CONDA_PY3_ENV
bash ./scripts/run_all.sh
```

If you read further, you can see the details and instructions related to each task in our experimental setting.

**NOTE: In most of the notebooks you have to select from the tennis datasets "rg17" or "uo17".**

## 1. Calculate centrality scores

You can calculate centrality scores for hourly snapshots with the following script.

```bash
source activate YOUR_CONDA_PY3_ENV
bash ./scripts/calculate_centrality_scores.sh
```

**It could take several hours** to calculate the scores for all parametrizations that is required for the following steps. That is the reason why we use **--ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=7200** configuration for  the **jupyter nbconvert** command. If the execution don't finish in 2 hours on your computer then you should increase this time limit.

### Related script:

   * [Centraity Score Computer](experiments/CentralityScoreComputer.py): export score files into folder **./data/DATASET_ID/centrality_scores/**.

### Notations of centrality measures

Each implemented centrality measure has a **score_id** that tries to capture the type and all the parameters of a given method. For example, the score\_id is **spr_snapshot_12_a0.85_i100** for static PageRank calculated on the last 12 hours of edge history with damping factor 0.85 and 100 iterations. The first part of the score\_id always describe the name of the centrality measure: 

   * ***tk*: temporal Katz centrality (our method)**
   * ***ttk*: truncated temporal Katz centrality (our method)**
   * *tpr*: [temporal PageRank](https://github.com/polinapolina/temporal-pagerank)
   * *spr*: static PageRank
   * *hc*: static Harmonic Centrality
   * *nbm*: static negative-Beta Measure
   * *indeg*: static indegree
   * *did*: decayed indegree

## 2. Experiments

You can run the experiments with the following script:

```bash
source activate YOUR_CONDA_PY3_ENV
bash ./scripts/run_experiments.sh
```

After you have run the script above, you can find several files related to the experiments (node labels, figures, NDCG@50 scores) in the **results/** folder of the repository.

### Related notebooks (execute them in this order):

   1. [Schedule Score Updater](experiments/ScheduleScoreUpdater.ipynb): Extract relevant nodes of the Twitter mention networks *(daily tennis player accounts)*. Prepare labels for the supervised evaluation.
   2. [Predict Tennis Player](experiments/PredictTennisPlayer.ipynb): Supervised evaluation for daily tennis player prediction based only on network centrality measures. The performance of temporal Katz centrality is compared with several baselines. **You must run [Centraity Score Computer](experiments/CentralityScoreComputer.py) and [Schedule Score Updater](experiments/ScheduleScoreUpdater.ipynb) notebooks before executing this notebook**. You have to specify the list of **score\_id**s (e.g. spr_snapshot_12_a0.85_i100) that you want to evaluate for Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG).
   3. [Concept Drift](experiments/ConceptDrift.ipynb): Unsupervised experiment that show that temporal Katz centrality can adapt to changes in the edges distribution.

# Troubleshooting

If you get a **"TimeoutError: Cell execution timed out"** when you run any of the provided bash scripts then you should increase the execution time limit for the **jupyter nbconvert** command for the notebook that had broken down. You can do this by using

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute  --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=HIGHER_TIME_LIMIT BROKEN_DOWN_NOTEBOOK.ipynb
```
 
 or just execute the given notebook through the Jupyter browser.
